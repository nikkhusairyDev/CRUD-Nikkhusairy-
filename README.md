# Introduction

Crud was built to be scaffolding on steroids, and allow developers to have
enough flexibility to use it for both rapid prototyping and production
applications, even on the same code base -- saving you time.

* Crud is [very fast to install](http://crud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/installation.html), a few minutes tops.

* Crud is very flexible and has tons of [configuration options](http://crud.readthedocs.org/en/latest/configuration.html).

* Crud aims to stay out of your way, and if it happens to get in your way, you can change the undesired
behavior very easily.

* Usually, the basic code for controller CRUD actions are very simple and always looks the same. Crud
will add the actions to your controller so you don't have to reimplement them over and over again.

# Step by step to Open Project Crud
